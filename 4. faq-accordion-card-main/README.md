## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

I'm quite confused about how to position the box so it can be responsive. So I made it a fixed size to the card. Because of my limitations on javascript, the accordion I can make is simple. But enough to help me understand javascript better.
