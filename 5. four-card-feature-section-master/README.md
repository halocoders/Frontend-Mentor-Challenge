## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

This is my first time to practice with SCSS. I'm happy with the result. It's pretty easy to make manage layout for responsivity. But I'm still confused with nesting. I need more practice to use SCSS with max performance.
