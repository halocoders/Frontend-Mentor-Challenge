## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The hard section that I have to do is on a background circle. Many display breakpoints that have to set. I don't know the best to manage that, so that have a responsive circle background.
